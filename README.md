# YTU-RACING-YTR08E
Description; **

Hello everyone! In this article, we will talk about the aluminum Power Supply 
Current Limiter PCB we designed for our electric vehicle YTR08C by YTU 
Racing in the Formula Student competition, the world's most prestigious 
undergraduate engineering competition, attended by university students from all 
over the world who are interested in motor racing.

**Details; **

This design is sponsored by JLCPCB. This article was brought to you by 
JLCPCB that is experienced, and do its job fast with high quality. You can order 
PCBs in any shape, up to 14 layers with awesome quality for a very low price 
with great customer service and they only arrived few days-3 days-after order!
With 16-year PCB manufacturing experience, JLCPCB also establishes a welltrained engineer&customer support team devoted to ensuring PCBA assembly 
service faster and cheaper, to ensure assemble your PCB in best service.
Thousands of components supported by JLCPCB and its reliable component 
partners, like DigiKey and Mouser. This benefits customers to source 
components much faster and easier, bringing you a shorter PCBA production 
time.

JLC PCB also performs Visual Inspection, X Ray, Solder Paste Inspection (SPI) 
controls. Detects if there is any bad solder paste printing. X-ray is used to check 
the quality of the solder joints (such as BGA) under the components on the line 
to ensure that the circuit board can achieve 100% test coverage.
Soldering options are also available.

**About the Power Supply Current Limiter PCB:**

Our team has a fixed 29A power supply to charge the low voltoge battery of the 
Combustion racing car. To charge the battery at lower current, we designed a 
current limiting circuit with the support of JLC PCB.
The voltage spent on the resistors works with the feedback system to the input of 
the opamp. The current you are limiting passes through the mosfets. Mosfets get 
very hot because the amount of current passing is too much. We recommend 
using a large heatsink.

**How to order PCB at JLCPCB;**

This design is sponsored by JLCPCB. After designing the circuit however you 
want, you can order your PCB and get it to your hand in a short time! We would 
like to thank JLCPCB for their support and we are very satisfied with the service 
we received. First, you have to export GERBER and NC files of your PCB files. 
JLCPCB explained how to do it you can visit the website. They communicate 
very quickly in the format of the PCB gerber file or in case determination that 
may cause any problems in terms of production and they deliver the PCB 
without any problems.

After that put the files into single rar file then get to the order page
You are even able to change PCB color for free. 
You can change the shipping method. JLCPCB ensures the delivery PCB to 
your hand for 3 days! 
You can check the website of JLCPCB. We want to thank again to JLCPCB for 
the great quality of its service. Thank you, JLCPCB
